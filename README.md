# Chat React

Chat React is a personal project designed to explore real-time chat functionality using React and Firestore. The goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience with Firebase services, authentication, and state management while building an interactive messaging platform.

## Project Overview

- **Real-time messaging** powered by Firestore
- **Google Authentication** for easy sign-in

## Why This Project?

This project was created as a learning opportunity to dive deeper into modern frontend development with React and Firebase. It helped me improve my skills in:

- Managing real-time data with Firestore
- Implementing authentication with Firebase
- Handling UI updates efficiently in a chat application

## Tech Stack

This project is built using the following technologies:

- **TypeScript** – for static typing and improved code maintainability
- **React** – for building the user interface, using hooks and context API for state management
- **Firebase** – for backend services:
  - Firestore (real-time database)
  - Firebase Authentication (Google sign-in)
  - Firebase Hosting (deploying the app)
- **SCSS** – for styling and maintaining a modular, scalable CSS structure

## Next Steps

I plan to enhance this project by adding:

- Typing indicators
- Message reactions
- Dark mode support
